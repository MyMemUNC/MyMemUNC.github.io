        <p>All operations entering Zone S-P-004-1 require approval at three hierarchical levels and must be led by a researcher of Grade A or higher. Personnel entering the zone must be equipped with a temporal-recording device and a cognitive-stabilization unit, and must complete a mirrored-memory backup prior to entry.</p>

        <p>Any S-P-004-2 (physical media) recovered within S-P-004-1 must be recorded on site, sealed, and immediately destroyed; only digital copies are to be retained. No physical S-P-004-2 material is permitted to leave the anomalous domain without explicit authorization.</p>

        <p>Unauthorized personnel are prohibited from approaching within 1 kilometer of any area designated as a potential S-P-004-1 activation locus. All individuals who have entered S-P-004-1 and experienced revival phenomena must undergo long-term observation and must be restricted from re-entering S-P-004-1 within short temporal intervals.</p>

        <p>S-P-004 lacks a fixed physical manifestation and cannot be subjected to conventional storage or relocation procedures.

        <p>If anomalous oscillations are detected in any region that approximate the 'witch' spectrum but are not attributable to any of the established twelve covens, such signals shall be treated as potential indicators of S-P-004 activation.

    <!-- Description -->
    <div class="content-section" id="section-description">
        <div class="section-title">Description</div>
        <p>S-P-004 is a geographically localized phenomenon that generates selective, conditional illusionary domains. Activations of S-P-004 do not exhibit consistent geographic patterns; however, activation loci are frequently co-located with sites where prior events produced unresolved volition, sustained psychological stress, or collective trauma among a significant portion of the local population. The triggering events may be anthropogenic or natural in origin.</p>

        <p>Upon fulfillment of specific conditions, S-P-004 produces an anomalous domain (designated S-P-004-1) at the site. To naïve observers the domain shows no overt anomaly, though sensing equipment detects spectrum fluctuations approximating the 'witch' signature. This spectral signature is inconsistent with all known twelve witch covens and indicates an independent source.</p>

        <p>Entry into S-P-004-1 is selective. Individuals meeting any of the following criteria will, upon approach, become unwittingly immersed in the illusionary domain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Long-term residency, frequent presence, or employment at the location.</li>
            <li>Possession of deep personal memories associated with the location.</li>
            <li>Persistent cognitive fixation on, or intense curiosity regarding, the location.</li>
            <li>Knowledge that the area is S-P-004-1 coupled with an expressed willingness to enter.</li>
            <li>[REDACTED]</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If an individual possesses explicit and detailed knowledge of the sequence of events, bears a direct causal relationship to the event, personally experienced the event while retaining complete memory thereof, or has previously exited the associated S-P-004-1, S-P-004 will not trigger for that individual. This is hypothesized to be a form of intrinsic exclusion mechanism.</p>

        <p>Subjective time within the illusion is synchronized with external time. The domain reconstructs scenes corresponding to a historical interval of the site, preferentially presenting social and interpersonal states that preceded the triggering event. Within S-P-004-1, a number of anomalous alterations to physical norms are observed: entrants maintain physiological stability without external intake of food or water while still experiencing sensations of hunger and thirst; nonetheless, no observed mechanism has produced immediate lethal outcomes to the biological substrate of entrants. Entrants continue to require regular sleep cycles to maintain cognitive function.</p>

        <p>All entrants receive a portable media object (designated S-P-004-2), typically a paper notebook; less commonly the object is an obsolete storage medium (audio tape, magnetic disk, etc.). Each S-P-004-2 is inscribed with the label "Akashic Record." S-P-004-2 records fragments of the entrant's past memories; the recorded contents contain a mixture of veridical and false elements, exhibiting blurring and memory displacement. S-P-004-2 updates automatically every 12 hours; content evolves dynamically in response to the entrant's actions within the illusion.</p>

        <p>Should an entrant die within the illusion, S-P-004 produces one of three outcomes according to as-yet undetermined criteria: the individual's corporeal form reappears in the central region of S-P-004-1, the original corpse vanishes entirely and the associated S-P-004-2 is simultaneously reconstructed; the individual is forcibly expelled from the anomalous domain and returns to external reality; or external confirmation of the individual's death occurs in baseline reality and the corresponding entity within S-P-004-1 disintegrates and dissipates. In the first two outcomes (revival or expulsion), the recovered individuals display marked declines in cognitive stability. Primary symptoms include psychomotor retardation, disordered speech, memory confusion, and impaired discrimination between the illusion and objective reality.</p>

        <p>An alternate confirmed method of exiting S-P-004-1 is completion of an implicit objective present within the illusion. This objective is not explicitly described and is believed to be related to the event background, unresolved actions, or a core historical nexus. Indirect clues may be obtained via interaction with entities within the illusion or by actively reconstructing the sequence of events and conducting iterative probes.</p>

        <p>Upon successful exit from S-P-004-1 the illusion and its spectral signature terminate immediately and the S-P-004 phenomenon ceases at that locus; however, observation indicates the phenomenon may re-emerge at unpredictable temporal offsets. At present there exist no methods for reliably preventing or forecasting reactivation.</p>
