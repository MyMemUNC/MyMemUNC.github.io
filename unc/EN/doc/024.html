                    <p>Following Incident [A-L-024b], and in light of the
                        extreme hazardous properties and anomalous effects of
                        A-L-024, all direct experimentation involving A-L-024 is
                        strictly prohibited. Research activities are restricted
                        exclusively to indirect data analysis and must utilize
                        non-optical sensors or approved non-visual observation
                        techniques. Any experimental proposal involving A-L-024
                        requires authorization from no fewer than two Level A
                        personnel and must be accompanied by a comprehensive
                        risk assessment report. Unauthorized experimental
                        activity will result in immediate quarantine and
                        disciplinary action.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All data records related to A-L-024—including, but not
                        limited to, sensor outputs, environmental monitoring
                        logs, and indirect observational results—must be
                        encrypted and stored on isolated servers, accessible
                        solely to Level A personnel. Any attempt to observe
                        A-L-024 through visual means—including unaided eye
                        contact, real-time video transmission, or optical
                        instrumentation—constitutes a breach of protocol and
                        will trigger automated security measures, including
                        on-site quarantine and memory suppression
                        procedures.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Personnel operating indirect observation equipment must
                        wear full protective gear, including sensory insulation
                        apparatus designed to block all external stimuli, to
                        mitigate potential anomalous influence. All operations
                        must be conducted under the direct supervision of at
                        least one Level A personnel and must maintain a minimum
                        distance of 50 meters from the A-L-024 containment
                        zone.</p>

                    <p>A-L-024 is to be contained within five hermetically
                        sealed containers constructed from heat-resistant,
                        high-strength alloy, each measuring 30 cm x 10 cm x 10
                        cm. Each unit must incorporate an independent multi-lock
                        security mechanism and be equipped with environmental
                        monitoring sensors providing continuous telemetry of
                        temperature, humidity, and anomalous energy
                        fluctuations. All containment units are to be housed
                        within a dedicated containment chamber located in a
                        high-security subterranean facility, reinforced with
                        multiple tiers of physical and electronic access control
                        systems to prevent unauthorized entry.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Proximity within 30 meters of the A-L-024 containment
                        zone is strictly restricted to Level A personnel or
                        above. Level A personnel authorized to enter must be
                        equipped with specialized protective equipment and
                        accompanied by a minimum of two security officers. Upon
                        exiting the containment area, all personnel are subject
                        to mandatory sensory function assessments and
                        psychological evaluations to detect potential anomalous
                        influence. Any deviation from baseline metrics is to be
                        reported immediately and will result in activation of
                        isolation protocols.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The containment chamber must maintain controlled
                        environmental conditions, with temperature stabilized
                        between 10°C and 15°C and humidity maintained below 40%
                        to suppress potential activity of A-L-024. Any deviation
                        from these parameters must be reported without delay and
                        reviewed by the assigned project lead. Full diagnostic
                        inspections of the chamber’s monitoring systems are to
                        be conducted at 48-hour intervals to verify structural
                        and operational integrity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the event of any structural compromise or system
                        anomaly affecting A-L-024 containment units or the
                        chamber environment, the facility is to initiate
                        immediate lockdown procedures. All personnel must
                        evacuate the affected area, and emergency response
                        protocols will be enacted under the authority of the
                        project lead. Any physical contact with A-L-024, whether
                        intentional or accidental, constitutes a critical
                        containment breach. All involved personnel are to be
                        isolated and subjected to comprehensive diagnostic
                        evaluation.</p>

                    <p>Only My Precious Rose (hereafter referred to as A-L-024)
                        comprises five specimens resembling common roses,
                        classified within the genus <em>Rosa</em> of the family
                        Rosaceae. While its physical appearance closely
                        resembles that of a standard rose, A-L-024 exhibits
                        anomalous properties that affect human sensory
                        perception. Upon any form of direct or indirect sensory
                        contact—particularly visual or tactile—subjects begin to
                        experience progressive degradation of all five senses
                        (sight, taste, smell, hearing, touch). Controlled
                        experiments have confirmed that prolonged exposure to
                        A-L-024 leads to a significant loss of sensory
                        perception with respect to all non-A-L-024 stimuli,
                        eventually resulting in near-complete sensory
                        deprivation except for stimuli originating from A-L-024
                        itself. Affected individuals report that A-L-024’s
                        color, scent, sound, texture, and flavor become
                        extraordinarily vivid—beyond normal human sensory
                        thresholds—while the rest of the environment becomes
                        increasingly dull, blurred, or unrecognizable. For
                        further information, refer to Document [A-L-024a].</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A-L-024 demonstrates a highly potent compulsion effect.
                        Subjects within approximately 10 meters of
                        A-L-024—regardless of prior knowledge or awareness of
                        its properties—report an involuntary and overwhelming
                        desire to approach the specimen. This compulsion often
                        manifests as a strong urge to stare at, touch, or
                        otherwise interact with A-L-024, and in some cases,
                        subjects exhibit profound emotional attachment.
                        Individuals may attempt to verbally or physically
                        express admiration, often referring to A-L-024 using
                        language associated with beauty or perfection. The
                        intensity of this compulsion correlates with both
                        exposure time and proximity, and is particularly
                        pronounced during direct visual contact. Notably, this
                        effect appears to bypass conventional cognitive
                        resistance; even personnel with extensive psychological
                        conditioning have demonstrated limited immunity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Direct observation of A-L-024—whether through unaided
                        visual inspection or real-time visual
                        transmission—triggers immediate onset of its anomalous
                        effects, resulting in rapid sensory degradation.
                        However, observation via indirect means, such as
                        artistic renderings, still photographs, or pre-recorded
                        video, does not activate the anomaly. This suggests that
                        A-L-024’s effects are intrinsically linked to its
                        "real-time presence," and that mediated representations
                        are incapable of conveying its sensory influence. For
                        supporting experimental data and incident documentation,
                        refer to Incident [A-L-024b].</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Further observation indicates that A-L-024's anomalous
                        effects are not limited to human subjects. Mammalian
                        test subjects (e.g., laboratory rats and canines)
                        exposed to A-L-024 exhibit similar signs of fixation,
                        accompanied by diminished responsiveness to other
                        sensory stimuli in the environment. The extent to which
                        A-L-024 affects plant life or inorganic matter remains
                        inconclusive due to insufficient data; however,
                        preliminary trials suggest the anomaly predominantly
                        targets organisms possessing advanced sensory
                        systems.</p>

                            <p>黑暗中，唯有那抹存在：</p>
                            <p>它低語著憂鬱，卻點燃唯一的渴望。</p>
                            <p>世界在眼前溶解、塌縮，</p>
                            <p>唯有它，錨定成最終的座標。</p>

                            <p>它的氣息是甜蜜的漩渦，</p>

                            <p>空氣裡，萬物氣味蒸發，</p>
                            <p>唯有它，是嗅覺盡頭唯一的印記。</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>它的柔軟是舌尖的蠱惑，</p>
                            <p>它的存在本身，是強烈的塌縮力場。</p>
                            <p>味蕾之上，世界失重、消散，</p>
                            <p>唯有它，是味覺宇宙唯一的奇點。</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>冰冷的真實，細膩的觸碰，</p>
                            <p>一次烙印，萬物仿品便蜂擁而至。</p>
                            <p>觸覺的海洋，萬物輪廓模糊，</p>
                            <p>唯有它，是觸感唯一確認的實體。</p>

                            <p>聲音的迷宮，萬物邏輯崩解，</p>
                            <p>唯有它，躍升為純粹頻率，唯一的圖騰。</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>抵抗徒勞，意志繳械。</p>
                            <p>沉醉於它，直至旅程的終章。</p>
                            <p>黑暗中，唯有那抹存在：</p>
                            <p>它的力量與美，如極星般恆定不移。</p>
