        <p class="w3-left-align">
          The UNC Foundation's primary goal is to secure and contain these anomalous objects in order to protect humanity from their potentially dangerous effects.
          <br>
          The Foundation operates on a global scale, with branches and facilities located all over the world. 
          <br>
          Its members, known as "Foundation personnel," are highly trained and specialized in a variety of fields, including science, engineering, and containment procedures. 
          <br>
          We work tirelessly to monitor and contain anomalous phenomena, often at great personal risk.
          <br>
          The Foundation is shrouded in secrecy, with the public at large completely unaware of its existence. 
          <br>
          It operates outside of government oversight and is funded through a variety of covert means. 
        </p>
